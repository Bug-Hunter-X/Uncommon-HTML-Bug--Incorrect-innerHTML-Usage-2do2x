This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML/JavaScript bug involving incorrect usage of innerHTML. The bug occurs because the JavaScript attempts to modify the innerHTML of an element before the element has fully loaded into the DOM. The solution shows how to correctly handle this by ensuring that the JavaScript executes after the element is available or by using event listeners to detect DOMContentLoaded.
